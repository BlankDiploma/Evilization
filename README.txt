Project "EVILIZATION"

Please keep in mind that this project is VERY EARLY in development! Stolen google images textures and MSPaint stick figures are everywhere!

The Elevator Pitch

EVILIZATION is a 4x game inspired by a passionate love/hate relationship with Civilization V. 

The goal is to take the "Bullying City-states for fun and profit" mechanic of Civ V and make it the focus of the game, along with multiplayer that doesn't make everybody involved wish they were dead.

Humans players take the role of various boogeymen throughout history, enslaving/terrorizing AI civilizations (and each other!) while researching new and better ways to be a jerk.

How to navigate the repo

If all you want to do is run the latest release build, you should run Evilization/Evilization.exe
Source code that is intended to be shared between this and future projects is in "Common Files".
The VS2012 .sln file and source code exclusive to this project can be found in Projects/Evilization.
Unfortunately, we are not providing a .sln file for previous versions of visual studio at this time.

Compiling the game will cause a number of files to be automatically generated by StructParse.exe to facilitate loading of game resources from disk. In general, anything in the "Autogen" folder falls into this category.

Starting the Game

The first thing you'll see when you open Evilization.exe is likely the Errors window. You can close this - nothing that gets committed to the main branch should have any fatal errors, so you can safely ignore whatever it's complaining about. If you don't see the errors window, great! We're doing our jobs.

Click "New Game" and wait a few seconds for map generation and tessellation to complete. There's no progress bar for this yet, sorry.

Once in the game, click and drag the map to scroll, and use the mousewheel to zoom. The frame rate is a bit lousy when you're zoomed out right now, depending on your hardware.

Things to do:
-Issue move orders to your stick figure by right-clicking the terrain. End Turn to watch him move.
-Click the button over your city to enter City Management, where you can assign workers to either harvest tiles (by clicking the map) or construct things (by clicking one of the empty circles in the bottom left). You only have three workers to assign total right now. If you want to test building a unit, assign 2 workers to tiles that produce hammers, one worker to one of the empty circles, and then click a unit from the list to add it to the production queue. End turn until it pops out.
-Click the Tech Tree button in the upper left and choose a tech to research. Harvesting the red devil icon from tiles in cities adds to your current tech's progress level. Finishing a tech unlocks new buildings/units for production.
-Use your imagination to consider how awesome everything will look when it's actually finished.

Major parts of the codebase

GameState/HexMap - Most gameplay logic is in these two files. The top-level function for gameplay logic is CGameState::Update().

FlexRenderer - D3D9-based renderer with optional dedicated render thread. (Currently running single-threaded for this project.) Contains support for 2d and 3d texture atlases, including ninepatch textures and font atlases.

StructParse/DefLibrary/TextureLibrary - "StructParse" is an external program that runs as a custom compile step. It analyzes source files in the current project looking for appropriately-tagged classes, structs and enums, and outputs a table of data for each one that allows these objects to be intelligently loaded from text files to represent game data. Also supports embedded LUA scripts. If you see any goofy macros in the codebase that don't appear to do anything, they are likely clues for StructParse to do its job.

FlexDebugConsole/FlexErrorWindow/Earray - Libraries intended to make development easier.

UILib - Basic UI library that supports LUA scripting. Most rendering is done via ninepatch textures.

Luabind (http://www.rasterbar.com/products/luabind.html) is included to save me from an early death from ulcers.

Game Design Stuff

Rather than taking a realistic approach, EVILIZATION aims to include supernatural/caricature antagonists from major periods of human history. Here's some VERY ROUGH ideas for units:

"Classical" era: Greek mythology - Minotaurs, Sirens, Barbarians
"High Fantasy" era: Tokeinesque/D&D -  Orcs, Dragons, Liches, Wizards, Slow zombies
"Inquisition" era: Demons, Ghosts, Spirits
"Victorian" era: Gargoyles, Vampires, Werewolves
"Silver Screen" era: Flying Saucers, Swamp men, Nazis/Communists, Mutants
"Modern" era: Fast zombies, Modern ghosts, Terrorists, Lawyers

Furthermore, there will be a couple of *major* differences from Civilization V:

- War does not need to be declared to attack/pillage other players' assets. Players should be constantly vying for resources.
- Unit allegiance is not automatically known. Espionage and other (TBD) gameplay mechanics must be employed to determine who owns the unit that's attacking you.
- Cities do not grow naturally and must be bolstered via captured slaves or constructued automatons (golems, undead workers, etc.)
